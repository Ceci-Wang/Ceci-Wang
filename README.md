- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ceci-Wang
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to produce new maths in Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning graduate entry-level Algebraic Geometry, Modern Geometry (and Lie groups), Algebraic Topology and Riemann Surfaces at Columbia University. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (not yet learned enough to collaborate to produce things?)
- 📫 How to reach me: at ww2450@columbia.edu
